# ConnectFour
Implementation of the 2-player ConnectFour board game. The idea of 2 players was mimicked by the use of two different Algorithms.


All source code is in the 'Game files' folder. There are 5 source files in total 'CheckWin.cpp', 'CheckWin.h', 'ConnectFour.cpp', 
'ConnectFour.h' and 'main.cpp'. There are also text files that show example outputs. 

Note:
1) The ConnectFour game opens 3 files (player1_blue.txt, player2_red.txt and input.txt)
2) You read in all the moves from player1 and store them in an array
3) You read in all the moves from player2 and store them in an array
4) Read in a board size
5) Play the game
6) Print the results
4) Repeat Step 4 until all the board sizes are done

The "input.txt" and "Output.txt" files are just sample files used while doing a test run of the game
but with different conditions given by you as the player in a modified "input.txt", a new "output.txt" 
will be produced.

Remember to follow the instructions in "ConnectFour_Brief.pdf" file

You may need to recreate the class ".cpp" and ".h" files depending on the IDE you're using to compile the game. This
is not necessary if you're running the files via a linux-based command line.
